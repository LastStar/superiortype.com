Kunda was originally designed for the text of the 38th edition of the Czech overground magazine Živel. The objective was to reinvent the aesthetic and structural principles of the humanistic antiqua into a fresh visual language. The type character is constituted by a lower medium height and quite notable shading of individual characters. The actual design drawing is symbiotic with calligraphic ornamentation and sharp contours. Italics, as a distinctive type face, are made much thinner and far more drawn out. Kunda Book was awarded at the European Design Awards in 2015.
