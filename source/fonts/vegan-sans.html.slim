The inspiration source for the Vegan was the Vega type, drawn by the Czech typographer and font designer Stanislav Mar≈°o. The original design used highly shaded character design with a lightly extended duct.

As the type needs to be used both for displays and texts, some radical changes in the drawing design and structure were necessary; I achieved this by optical thinning and darker shading of individual characters.

The result is a type that saves space when longer texts are being set and, thanks to the shading, is perfectly legible even in smaller sizes and, in caption sizes, unmistakable in appearance.
